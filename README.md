## New Requirements for Social Media Apps in Australia  

###### December 8, 2025  
<div class="article-text"><p>Beginning December 10, 2025, a new Australian law will require certain social media platforms operating in Australia to prevent people under 16 from having a social media account. Impacted developers are responsible for making sure they follow the requirements of the new law, including deactivating any existing accounts for users under 16 and monitoring new signups.</p><p>Apple provides several tools to help meet the requirements of this law:</p><p><strong>Declared Age Range API</strong></p><p>The new Declared Age Range API helps developers provide age-appropriate experiences for their users. Developers can choose to request the age range that is most relevant to their use case, such as an age range of under 16, and modify app behavior based on this information.</p><p><strong>App description on the AppStore</strong></p><p>When making an app available on the AppStore, developers must include a description that helps users determine whether the app is appropriate for them. Developers can use this app description field to indicate information that may not be captured in other areas of the product page, such as social media age restrictions for people under a certain age. </p><p><strong>In-app controls on the AppStore product page</strong></p><p>This year, Apple updated the age ratings questionnaire that is required for all apps. The update included adding new questions about in-app controls, such as the presence of age assurance and parental controls. Apps using age assurance methods — such as the Declared Age Range API — to comply with the law and prevent users under 16 from creating accounts can indicate the presence of this capability on their AppStore product page.</p><p><strong>Higher minimum age rating</strong></p><p>With our recent update to age ratings, developers can set a higher age rating than the one generated by their responses to the age ratings questionnaire in AppStoreConnect. Developers can view the age rating for each of their apps and select a higher rating if they wish, in the App Information section in <a href="https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/login">AppStore Connect</a>.</p><p><strong>Age Suitability URL</strong></p><p>When updating an app's age rating, developers have the option to include an Age Suitability URL that links to a developer-hosted website with details about the app and its age-related content. When enabled, this URL appears on the AppStore product page under the age ratings details section. Developers can use this URL to provide region-specific information and requirements, such as the prohibition in Australia of people under 16 having a social media account.</p><p><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/declaredagerange">Learn more about the Declared Age <span class="icon icon-after icon-chevronright nowrap">Range API</span></a></p><p><a href="https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/manage-app-information/set-an-app-age-rating/">Learn more about updating your app’s <span class="icon icon-after icon-chevronright nowrap">age rating</span></a></p><p><a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/product-page/">Learn more about an app’s <span class="icon icon-after icon-chevronright nowrap">product page</span></a></p></div>
